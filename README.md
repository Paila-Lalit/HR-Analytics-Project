# HR-Analytics-Project

## Project Overview 
HR Analytics project focused on employee retention strategies and predictive modeling.

In today's competitive landscape, leveraging data-driven insights is key to optimizing HR strategies. My Power BI project delves deep into employee data, offering invaluable insights for talent management, performance evaluation, and organizational development.

Through dynamic visualizations and interactive dashboards, we're able to uncover trends, identify patterns, and make informed decisions that drive business success. From tracking recruitment metrics to measuring employee engagement, Power BI empowers HR professionals to enhance workforce efficiency and effectiveness.

Data Loading - Integrate transformed data into Power BI for processing.

Data Modeling - Organize and relate data elements to create a logical framework.

DAX Formulas - Utilize dynamic expressions for complex calculations and insights.

Report Building - Craft intuitive visualizations and dashboards for informed decision-making.

## Total KPIs: Comprehensive analysis of key performance indicators (KPIs) across departments.

𝐀𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐠𝐞 𝐀𝐭𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐑𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐀𝐥𝐥 𝐃𝐞𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬: 

Definition: The average rate at which employees leave the company across all departments.

Purpose: Helps identify overall employee turnover trends and potential issues within specific departments.

Current Value: 50.21%

Interpretation: This indicates that, on average, 50.21% of the workforce across all departments leaves the organization over a certain period. This high attrition rate could signal potential issues in employee satisfaction, engagement, or other organizational factors.

𝐀𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐠𝐞 𝐇𝐨𝐮𝐫𝐥𝐲 𝐑𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐌𝐚𝐥𝐞 𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐜𝐡 𝐒𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐬: 

Definition: The average hourly rate of male employees in the role of Research Scientist.

Purpose: Useful for analyzing pay equity, budgeting, and salary benchmarking within this specific job role.

Current Value: 114.45

Interpretation: This figure represents the mean hourly compensation for male Research Scientists, which can be used to compare with industry standards or evaluate pay equity within the organization.

𝐀𝐭𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐑𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐯𝐬. 𝐌𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐡𝐥𝐲 𝐈𝐧𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐞 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐬:

Definition: A comparative analysis of the attrition rate relative to the monthly income of employees.

Purpose: To determine if there is a correlation between how much employees are paid and their likelihood of leaving the company.

Total Attrition Rate: 50.21%

Total Monthly Income: $1,30,07,89,063

Interpretation: By comparing these values, one can analyze if there's a correlation between employees' monthly income and their likelihood to leave the company. High attrition despite high total income might indicate issues unrelated to pay, such as work culture or job satisfaction.

𝐀𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐠𝐞 𝐖𝐨𝐫𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐘𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐬 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐄𝐚𝐜𝐡 𝐃𝐞𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭:

Definition: The average number of years employees have worked within each department.

Purpose: Helps in understanding employee tenure and experience level in different departments.

Current Value: 20 years

Interpretation: This long average tenure suggests a stable workforce with significant experience within their departments, which could be a strength for organizational knowledge but also a potential risk if many experienced employees retire or leave simultaneously.

𝐉𝐨𝐛 𝐑𝐨𝐥𝐞 𝐕𝐬. 𝐖𝐨𝐫𝐤-𝐋𝐢𝐟𝐞 𝐁𝐚𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞: 

Definition: An analysis of the perceived work-life balance across different job roles.

Purpose: To assess employee satisfaction and potential areas of improvement in work-life balance policies.

Current Value: 2.51 (assuming a scale, e.g., 1 to 5)

Interpretation: This average score of 2.51 indicates that employees might be moderately dissatisfied with their work-life balance, suggesting a need for policies to improve flexibility, reduce burnout, and enhance overall job satisfaction.

𝐀𝐭𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐑𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐯𝐬. 𝐘𝐞𝐚𝐫 𝐒𝐢𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐋𝐚𝐬𝐭 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐦𝐨𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐑𝐞𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: 

Definition: Analyzing the relationship between the attrition rate and the number of years since employees' last promotion.

Purpose: To determine if a lack of career progression is a factor in employee turnover.

Interpretation: Typically, longer periods without promotion might correlate with higher attrition rates, as employees may seek career advancement opportunities elsewhere if they feel stagnated. Specific data points or trends would be needed to provide a precise interpretation.

## Conclusion

By leveraging these KPIs, the HR department can gain a comprehensive understanding of workforce dynamics and implement targeted interventions to enhance employee retention, satisfaction, and overall organizational health. Further detailed data analysis and visualization using tools like Excel, Power BI, or specialized HR analytics software would provide deeper insights and actionable recommendations.
