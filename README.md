## Project Overview 
HR Analytics project focused on employee retention strategies and predictive modeling.

In today's competitive landscape, leveraging data-driven insights is key to optimizing HR strategies. My Power BI project delves deep into employee data, offering invaluable insights for talent management, performance evaluation, and organizational development.
